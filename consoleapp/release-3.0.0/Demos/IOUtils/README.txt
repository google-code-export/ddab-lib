This directory is provided for the units from the DelphiDabbler I/O Utility
Classes project that are required to build some of the demos.

See the README file in the Demos directory with each demo for details of which,
if any, of the I/O Utility Classes units are used by which demos.

You can download a zip file containing the I/O Utility Classes project from
http://delphidabbler.com/software/ioutils/download

Once you have downloaded the project, copy the required units from the zip file
into this directory.
