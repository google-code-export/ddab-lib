; ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Release 3.0 of 25 March 2013
+ The PJPipes, PJPipeFilters and PJFileHandle units were all removed from the project. They are now part of the I/O Utilities Classes project.
+ Modifications made to support compilation with Delphi XE2 and later:
  - Unit names references in project source files are now qualified with the unit's namespace name when compiled with Delphi XE2 and later.
  - The reference to the Graphics unit was replaced with System.UITypes in Delphi XE2 and later to remove the unit's dependency on the VCL permitting its use in FireMonkey projects.
+ Updated demos:
  - All VCL demo form fonts changed to Arial 9pt.
  - VCL demo forms are no longer scaled.
  - Provided read-me file to explain how to build demos.
