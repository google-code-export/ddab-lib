= !ScreenBufferSize property =

*Project:* [ConsoleAppClasses  Console Application Runner Classes].

*Unit:* _PJConsoleApp_.

*Class:* _[TPJConsoleApp TPJConsoleApp]_.

*Introduced:* v2.0

{{{
property ScreenBufferSize: TSize;
}}}

== Description ==

Specifies the size of a console's screen buffer in character columns and rows. If either dimension is zero or negative the default buffer size is used.

If a console application shares a console this property has no effect.

The property defaults to (0, 0).

*Note 1:* A function named _!MakeSize_ is provided to create a _TSize_ record with specified values on the fly. This should be used when setting the property value since the _cx_ and _cy_ fields of _!ScreenBufferSize_ cannot be written to directly.

*Note 2:* This property does not set the size of the console window on screen. To do that use _[TPJConsoleAppWindowSize WindowSize]_.
