_TPJVersionNumber_ is a record that stores version numbers from version resources as four discrete values. The record is declared as follows:

{{{
TPJVersionNumber = record
  V1, V2, V3, V4: WORD;
end;
}}}

_V1_ represents the most significant version number and _V4_ represents the least significant number.

For example a version number written as 2.5.8.3 would be stored in a variable of type _TPJVersionNumber_ with _V1_=2, _V2_=5, _V3_=8 and _V4_=3.
