*Project:* [DropFilesComponents Drop Files Components].

*Unit:* _PJDropFiles_.

This non-visual component catches all `WM_DROPFILES` messages that are received by the form where it is placed. The component therefore intercepts files dragged from Windows Explorer and dropped anywhere on the form, including the non-client areas. Use _TPJFormDropFiles_ whenever you just need to catch files anywhere on the main window without bothering about which particular control the files are dropped on.
