== Description ==

Use this read-only property to get information about the release attributes of a file.

_!FileFlags_ holds information (as a bit-set) about the attributes of the file as specified in the fixed file information part of the _VERSIONINFO_ resource.

File flags information is also provided by the _dwFileFlags_ member of the _VS_FIXEDFILEINFO_ structure which can be accessed using the _[TPJVersionInfoFixedFileInfo FixedFileInfo]_ property. 

The bit set can contain any of the following values:

|| *Flag* || *Description* ||
|| `VS_FF_DEBUG` || File contains debugging information. ||
|| `VS_FF_INFOINFERRED` || Some of the members in this structure may be empty or incorrect. ||
|| `VS_FF_PATCHED` || The file is not identical to the original file with the same version number. ||
|| `VS_FF_PRERELEASE` || The file is a development version. ||
|| `VS_FF_PRIVATEBUILD` || The file is not a standard release. If this flag is set the _!PrivateBuild_ property should contain further information. ||
|| `VS_FF_SPECIALBUILD` || The file is a variation of a standard release with the same version number. If this flag is set then the _!SpecialBuild_ property should contain further information. ||

The `VS_FF_XXX` constants are defined in the Windows unit.

The _[TPJVersionInfoFileFlagsMask FileFlagsMask]_ property determines which of the bits in this flag are valid.
