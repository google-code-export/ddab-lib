== Description ==

_!ProcessInfo_ is a read only property that provides process information for the executing console application. All fields are zero when no application is executing.

_!ProcessInfo_ is only of use inside _[TPJConsoleAppOnWork OnWork]_ or _[TPJConsoleAppOnComplete OnComplete]_ event handlers since these are the only way of accessing it when a process is running. Outside these events _!ProcessInfo_ is undefined and should not be read.

See the Windows API help for information about the fields of _TProcessInformation_.
