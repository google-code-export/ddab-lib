*Project:* [SystemInformationUnit System Information Unit].

*Unit:* _PJSysInfo_.

*Class:* _[TPJOSInfo TPJOSInfo]_

{{{
class function IsServer: Boolean;

== Description ==

Returns true if the operating system is a server system or False if not.

When the program is run in compatibility mode, this method may report the "emulated" operating system. When emulating a server operating system when using a desktop system _!IsServer_ continues to report `False`, but this behaviour may not be reliable across every combination of real and emaulated operating systems.

[v5.0] On operating systems where _[TPJOSInfoCanSpoof CanSpoof]_ returns `False` this method will report the correct operating system, regardless of any compatibility mode.

[v5.0] When running on Windows 2000 and later you can use _[TPJOSInfoIsWindowsServer IsWindowsServer]_ to ensure that compatibility mode has no effect on the returned value.
