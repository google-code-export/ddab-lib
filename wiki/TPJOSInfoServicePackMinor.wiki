*Project:* [SystemInformationUnit System Information Unit].

*Class:* _[TPJOSInfo TPJOSInfo]_

== Description ==

On the NT platform from NT 4 service pack 6 onwards _!ServicePackMinor_ returns the minor version number of any service pack applied to the operating system. Zero is returned if no service pack has been applied. On earlier versions of Windows NT or on the Windows 9x platform, zero is always returned.

The corresponding major service pack version number is provided by the _[TPJOSInfoServicePackMajor ServicePackMajor]_ method. A full description of the service pack, for any product, is available via the _[TPJOSInfoServicePack ServicePack]_ method.

When the program is run in compatibility mode, this method will report the service pack minor version of the "emulated" operating system. 

[v5.0] On operating systems where _[TPJOSInfoCanSpoof CanSpoof]_ returns `False` this method will report the correct operating system, regardless of any compatibility mode.
