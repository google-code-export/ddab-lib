#summary Stream Extension Classes documentation.

= Stream Extension Classes =

This library project provides some classes that can be used to extend the functionality of Delphi's TStream classes.

The classes are provided in two units: PJStreamWrapper and PJIStreams. The classes are summarised in the following table.

|| *Class* || *Unit* || *Description* ||
|| [TPJStreamWrapper] || PJStreamWrapper || This is a base class for descendant classes that "wrap" a TStream class to provide some form of filter or additional functionality. The wrapped TStream is used to do physical i/o. TStreamWrapper simply replicates the facilities in the wrapped stream â€“ it is for descendant classes to add functionality. ||
|| [TPJIStreamWrapper] || PJIStreams || Implements the IStream interface for a wrapped TStream object. ||
|| [TPJHandleIStreamWrapper] || PJIStreams || Implements an IStream interface for a wrapped THandleStream object or descendant such as TFileStream). Acts in a similar way to TPJIStreamWrapper except that file date stamps are returned by the Stat method. ||
|| [TPJFileIStream] || PJIStreams || Implements a IStream interface on a file. ||
