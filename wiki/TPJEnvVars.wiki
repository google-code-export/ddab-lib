*Project:* [EnvironmentVariablesUnit Environment Variables Unit].

*Unit:* _PJEnvVars_.

This component provides access to the environment variables in the current process' environment block. Environment variables can be read, created, updated or deleted. The names of all available environment variables can also be enumerated.

Only one instance of a _TPJEnvVars_ component can be placed on any form. An attempt to place further instances on a form causes an exception to be raised.

== Methods ==

_TPJEnvVars_ defines the following methods in addition to those inherited from
_TComponent_.

|| *Method* || *Description* ||
|| _[TPJEnvVarsCreate Create]_ || Object constructor. Permits only one instance to be placed on any form. ||
|| _[TPJEnvVarsDeleteVar DeleteVar]_ || Deletes an environment variable. ||
|| _[TPJEnvVarsEnumNames EnumNames]_ || _This is a redundant method provided for backward compatibility reasons only._ It enumerates all environment variable names, passing each name to a callback method. _[TPJEnvVarsGetEnumerator GetEnumerator]_ or <strong>for..in</strong> loops, where supported, should be used in preference. ||
|| _[TPJEnvVarsGetEnumerator GetEnumerator]_ || Creates an enumerator that can be used to enumerate all environment variable names. On Delphi 2005 and later this enumerator enables the <strong>for..in</strong> construct to be used with the component. ||
