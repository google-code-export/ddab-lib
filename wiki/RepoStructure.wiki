= Source Code Repository Structure =

The subversion repository for the !DelphiDabbler Component and Unit Library is structured as follows:

<pre>
branches                    unused at present
tags                        all stable releases
  projects                  stable releases of each sub-project
    proj-id                 stable releases of a sub-project: one dir per project
      release-x.x           contains a release: one dir per release
      ...
    ...                     
  lib                       stable releases of whole library
    release-x.x             contains a library release: one dir per release
    ...
trunk                       main development tree
  projects                  development tree for sub-projects
    proj-id                 development tree of a sub-project: one dir per project
    ...
  lib                       development tree for whole library
wiki                        contains library wiki</pre>                

== "branches" tree ==

The `branches` tree is currently unused.

== "tags" tree ==

The `tags` tree contains stable releases of each of the library's constituent projects and the complete library.

The project releases are contained in the `projects` sub-directory, which in turn has a further sub-directory for each project, named for the project's id. Within that directory is a set of `release-x.x` directories, one for each stable release contained within the repository.

The `lib` directory contains release of the complete library. Each release again has its own sub-directory.

== "trunk" tree ==

The `trunk` tree contains current development code. It is not guaranteed to be stable, but contains the latest updates. 

Updates to individual projects are stored in the `projects` sub tree, where there is one sub-directory for each project, named for the project id.

The `lib` subtree contains development code that applies to the whole library.

== "wiki" tree ==

This tree contains the documents that comprise the library's Wiki on Google Code.
