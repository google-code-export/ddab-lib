= TPJCtrlDropFiles =

*Project:* [DropFilesComponents Drop Files Components].

*Unit:* _PJDropFiles_.

This non-visual component catches all `WM_DROPFILES` messages that are received by a control referenced by the _[TPJCtrlDropFilesManagedControl ManagedControl]_ property. The component therefore intercepts files dragged from Windows Explorer and dropped on the managed control.

Use _TPJCtrlDropFiles_ when you want to take different actions depending on which control files are dropped on - you can use a different _TPJCtrlDropFiles_ component for each control that can receive file drops.
