== Description ==

When true this property forces the dialog box to use the operating system's deafult font. When false (the default) the font the dialog box was designed with is used.

The property is designed to enable the specific default fonts used on Windows XP and later to be used.

*Warning:* On some operating systems the font is larger than the design font and careful note should be made to ensure text is not truncated in the dialog box.

The default value is False.
