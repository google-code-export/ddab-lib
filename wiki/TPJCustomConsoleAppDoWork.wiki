== Description ==

This virtual protected method triggers the _[TPJConsoleAppOnWork OnWork]_ event. Descendants can override to perform specific actions without triggering the event. If the event is still required `inherited` can be called.

The method would usually be implemented to perform any required actions at the end of each of the console application's time slices.
