= !ThreadAttrs property =

*Project:* [ConsoleAppClasses  Console Application Runner Classes].

*Unit:* _PJConsoleApp_.

*Class:* _[TPJConsoleApp TPJConsoleApp]_.

{{{
property ThreadAttrs: PSecurityAttributes;
}}}

== Description ==

_!ThreadAttrs_ specifies the security and inheritance attributes for the console application's primary thread. It determines whether the thread handle can be inherited by child processes. Leaving as `nil` means the thread handle can't be inherited.

Note that the caller is responsible for setting up the structure correctly. The caller need not maintain a copy of the provided structure once the property is set since _[TPJConsoleApp TPJConsoleApp]_ makes an internal copy.

The default value is `nil`.
