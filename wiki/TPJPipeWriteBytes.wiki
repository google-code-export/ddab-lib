== Description ==

This method writes the whole content of a byte array to the pipe. Parameters are:

 * _Bytes_: Array of bytes to write to the pipe.

An _EInOutError_ exception is raised if the pipe's write handle has been closed or the pipe can't be written to.

*Note*: On versions of Delphi where _TBytes_ is not defined in _!SysUtils_, _PJPipe_ defines it as:

{{{
type TBytes = array of Byte;
}}}
