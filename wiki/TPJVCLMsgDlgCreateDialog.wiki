== Description ==

The _!CreateDialog_ method creates an instance of a dialog box and returns it. This instance is customised according to the component's properties. However, no sound is played by this method regardless of the state of the _[TPJVCLMsgDlgMakeSound MakeSound]_ property.

Note that the method's caller is responsible for showing and freeing dialog box instances created by this method.
