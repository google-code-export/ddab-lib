Returns a value from the _TPJOSProduct_ enumeration that identifies the operating system product. _Product_ can be thought of as the marketing name for the operating system - e.g. Windows NT, Windows Vista, Windows 98.

If a product cannot be identified then then either _osUnknownWinNT_ or _osUnknownWin9x_ is returned depending on the platform. If the platform is Win32s then the product is returned as _osUnknownWin32s_. Finally, if the product cannot be identified at all, _osUnknown_ is returned.

To find the string representation of the product name use the _[TPJOSInfoProductName ProductName]_ method.
