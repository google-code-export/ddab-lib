= Version Information Component =

This project contains one unit - _PJVersionInfo_ - that implements a non-visual component for reading version information, a record that encapsulates a version number and some public helper functions.

This wiki is divided into several sections:

|| _[TPJVersionInfo TPJVersionInfo]_ || The non-visual component that reads version information from any executable file's resources and exposes the information via properties. ||
|| _[TPJVersionNumber TPJVersionNumber]_ || A record that stores version numbers as four discreet values. On Delphi 2006 and later the record also overloads the equality operators to permit comparison and also supports assignment to a string. ||
|| [PJVersionInfoFunctions Public Functions] || Public functions that help manipulate and format _[TPJVersionNumber TPJVersionNumber]_ records. Aimed mainly at users of Delphi 2005 and earlier who don't have the extended functionality of the _[TPJVersionNumber TPJVersionNumber]_ record. ||
|| [VerInfoExamples Examples] || Examples showing how to use the component. ||
