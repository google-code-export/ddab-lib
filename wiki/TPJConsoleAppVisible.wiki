== Description ==

This property determines whether the console application is to be displayed. The behaviour of this property depends on whether _[TPJConsoleApp TPJConsoleApp]_ is hosted in a GUI or console application, and on the value of the _[TPJConsoleAppUseNewConsole UseNewConsole]_ property.

When _[TPJConsoleAppTPJConsoleApp TPJConsoleApp]_ is hosted by a console application, behaviour depends on the value of the _[TPJConsoleAppUseNewConsole UseNewConsole]_ property as follows:

 * If _[TPJConsoleAppUseNewConsole UseNewConsole]_ is `True` a console window is only displayed when _Visible_ is `True`. When _Visible_ is `False` no new console window is displayed and output from the process is not displayed.

 * When _[TPJConsoleAppUseNewConsole UseNewConsole]_ is `False` the program being executed displays its output in the host's console, regardless of the state of the _Visible_ property.

 * When the host program is a GUI application the process uses a new console window regardless of the state of _[TPJConsoleAppUseNewConsole UseNewConsole]_. The console window is displayed only if the _Visible_ property is `True`.

This property defaults to `False`.
