This method copies data from the pipe to a stream. Parameters are:

 * _Count_: Number of bytes to copy. If 0 then all the remaining data in the pipe is copied to the stream.

An _EInOutError_ exception is raised if there is an error peeking or reading the pipe.

if the pipe's write handle has been closed or if the pipe can't be written to. _EWriteError_ is raised if the stream write fails.
