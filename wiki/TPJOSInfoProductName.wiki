== Description ==

Returns the name of the operating system product. The product can be thought of as the marketing name for the operating system. If the product can't be determined then the empty string is returned.

The product name for both Windows NT 3.51 and Windows NT 4 is "Windows NT". Use the _[TPJOSInfoMajorVersion MajorVersion]_ and _[TPJOSInfoMinorVersion MinorVersion]_ methods to distinguish between them. 

A unique code representing the OS product can be found by using the _[TPJOSInfoProduct Product]_ method.

When the program is run in compatibility mode, this method may report the "emulated" operating system.

[v5.0] On operating systems where _[TPJOSInfoCanSpoof CanSpoof]_ returns `False` this method will report the correct operating system, regardless of any compatibility mode.
