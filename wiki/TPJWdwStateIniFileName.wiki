== Description ==

This property specifies the name of the ini file that will be used to record the window's size, position and state. The file is accessed by both the _[TPJWdwStateRestore Restore]_ and _[TPJWdwStateSave Save]_ methods.

The section to use in the ini file is set by the _[TPJWdwStateSection Section]_ property.

If the property is set to the empty string then the file name used has the same path and file name as the application except that the `'.exe'` extension is replaced by `'.ini'`. The empty string is the default value.
