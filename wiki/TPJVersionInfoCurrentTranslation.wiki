== Description ==

This run time property gets or sets the translation to be used by the string file information, language and character set related properties.

Version information resources can contain variable information in more that one langauge / character set combination. _TPJVersionInfo_ defines each of these combinations as a "Translation".

Translations are specified by assigning a zero based index to the _!CurrentTranslation_ property. Valid values for _!CurrentTranslation_ are in the range `0..NumTranslations-1`. If an attempt is made to set _!CurrentTranslation_ outside this range then the property is given the value -1. _!CurrentTranslation_ is set to zero when a file is first accessed (i.e. when the _[TPJVersionInfoFileName FileName]_ property is assigned or when the component is first created) or -1 if there is no version information in a file.
