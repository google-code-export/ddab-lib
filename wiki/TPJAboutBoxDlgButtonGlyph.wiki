== Description ==

The About box contains one button which is used to close the dialog box. The button can display a glyph (bitmap) to indicate its use. This property is used to determine which (if any) glyph to display. Valid values for the property and their meanings are as follows:


|| *Value* || *Meaning* ||
|| `abgOK` || A green check mark appears on the button face. ||
|| `abgCancel` || A red cross appears on the button face. ||
|| `abgIgnore` || A green man walking away appears on the button face. ||
|| `abgClose` || A door appears on the button face. ||
|| `abgNone` || No glyph is displayed on the button. ||

!_ButtonGlyph_ defaults to `abgNone`. (Was `abgOK` in versions prior to v3.5).

NB: If the deprecated _!AutoDetectGlyphs_ property is True then the value of the _!ButtonGlyph_ property will be ignored. You are advised to ensure that _!AutoDetectGlyphs_ is set to False.
