There are two units, _UPJConsoleApp_ and _UPJPipe_. The classes contained in the units are summarised in the following table:

|| *Class* || *Unit* || *Description* ||
|| _[TPJCustomConsoleApp TPJCustomConsoleApp]_ || _UPJConsoleApp_ || Base class for _[TPJConsoleApp TPJConsoleApp]_ that provides all the functionality of the derived class, except that all properties are protected. _TPJCustomConsoleApp_ should be used if you need to create subclasses. Subclasses must make any required properties public. ||
|| _[TPJConsoleApp TPJConsoleApp]_ || _UPJConsoleApp_ || Runs console applications. It enables the console application's standard input, standard output and standard error to be redirected to and from files or pipes. ||
|| _[TPJPipe TPJPipe]_ || _UPJPipe_ || Helper class that assists in working with pipes used for redirecting input / output. This class simplifies reading and writing to pipes. ||
