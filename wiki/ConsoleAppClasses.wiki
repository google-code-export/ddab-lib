= Console Application Runner Classes =

This library project provides some classes that are designed to be used to control the execution of child console application processes and to redirect input and output where required.

There are two units, _PJConsoleApp_ and _PJPipe_. The classes contained in the units are summarised in the following table:

|| *Class* || *Unit* || *Description* ||
|| _[TPJCustomConsoleApp TPJCustomConsoleApp]_ || _PJConsoleApp_ || Base class for _[TPJConsoleApp TPJConsoleApp]_. Provides all functionality but declares all properties protected. Use this class if creating sub-classes that do not want to make all properties public or need to execute custom code within the class rather than handling events. ||
|| _[TPJConsoleApp TPJConsoleApp]_ || _PJConsoleApp_ || Main console application class. Makes all properties inherited from _[TPJCustomConsoleApp TPJCustomConsoleApp]_ public. Use instances of this class when working with console processes. ||
|| _[TPJPipe TPJPipe]_ || _PJPipe_ || Helper class to use when redirecting console application standard input, output and error channels using pipes. ||
