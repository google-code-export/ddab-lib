== Description ==

Event handler type for _[TPJDropFilesOnFileFilter OnFileFilter]_ events, triggered for each file and folder dropped after processing by any filter component. This event can be handled to apply custom filtering to each file and folder.

_!FileName_ is the name of the file or folder being filtered. _!IsFolder_ is true if _!FileName_ denotes a folder. The state of the _Accept_ flag determines if _!FileName_ is to be added to the list of dropped files / folders. _Accept_ is true by default - set it to false to omit the file from the list of dropped files and folders.
