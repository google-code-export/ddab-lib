*Unit:* _PJEnvVars_. 

*Class:* _[TPJEnvVars TPJEnvVars]_

{{{
procedure DeleteVar(const Name: string);
}}}

== Description ==

Deletes the named environment variable. Does nothing if the environment variable does not exist. This is functionally the same as setting `Values[Name] := '';`

A _[EPJEnvVars EPJEnvVars]_ exception is raised if it is not possible to delete the variable.

*NOTE:* This method has no effect on the system environment variables, only on the copy of the environment maintained by this program.
