== Description ==

Set the _!HelpContext_ property to the context number of the relevant topic in the help file specified by the _[TPJWinMsgDlgHelpFile HelpFile]_ property. When a non-zero help context number is specified a help button is displayed in the dialogue box which calls context sensitive help with the given help context when pressed.

Changing the value of _!HelpContext_ from zero to non-zero and back again changes the value of the _[TPJWinMsgDlgDlgType DlgType]_ property. See the _[TPJWinMsgDlgDlgType DlgType page]_ for full details.

If the _[TPJWinMsgDlgOnHelp OnHelp]_ is not handled and a help button is pressed, a request is made to the _Application_ object to pass the help context along to the currently registered help system.
