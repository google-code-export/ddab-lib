*Project:* [MessageDialogComponents Message Dialog Components].

*Unit:* _PJMessageDialog_.

*Class:* _[TPJVCLMsgDlg TPJVCLMsgDlg]_

{{{

== Description ==

Set the _!HelpFile_ property to specify the help file to be used when a Help button is clicked or F1 is pressed in the dialog. If _!HelpFile_ is set to the empty string then the help file associated with the parent form or application is used.

The _[TPJVCLMsgDlgHelpContext HelpContext]_ property is used to specify the help topic within the help file that is to be displayed. 

*Note:* This property requires that !WinHelp is available, which it is not by default on Windows Vista and later. To use alternative help systems you must handle the _[TPJVCLMsgDlgOnHelp OnHelp]_ event.
