== Description ==

The buttons which appear in the dialog box depend on the value of this property. The possible values are:

|| *Value* || *Buttons used* ||
|| `bgAbortRetryIgnore` || Abort, Retry and Ignore buttons. ||
|| `bgOK` || A single OK button. ||
|| `bgOKCancel` || An OK and a Cancel button. ||
|| `bgRetryCancel` || A Retry and a Cancel button. ||
|| `bgYesNo` || A Yes and a No button. ||
|| `bgYesNoCancel` || Yes, No and Cancel buttons. ||
|| `bgUnkown` || An unsupported or unknown group of buttons. This item is for use in _[TPJVCLMsgDlg TPJVCLMsgDlg]_ and should not be selected in _TPJWinMsgDlg_. If it is selected it has the same effect as `bgOK`. ||

To include a help button in the dialog box set the _[TPJWinMsgDlgHelpContext HelpContext]_ property to some non-zero value.

A value associated with the button that was clicked is returned from the _[TPJWinMsgDlgExecute Execute]_ method.

The default value of the property is `bgOK`.
