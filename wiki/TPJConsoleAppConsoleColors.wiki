== Description ==

This property specifies the size of a console's screen buffer character columns and rows. If either dimension is zero or negative the default buffer size is used.

If a console app shares a console this property has no effect.

The colour enumeration values have the same colour as the similarly named _TColor_ constants.

The default values are `ccWhite` for the foreground and `ccBlack` for the background.

*Note:* A _TPJConsoleColors_ record can be created using the _!MakeConsoleColors_ function. There are two overloaded versions of this function, one which takes TPJConsoleColor parameters and another that takes TColor parameters. The latter version raises an exception if the TColor values do not have an equivalent TPJConsoleColor value.
