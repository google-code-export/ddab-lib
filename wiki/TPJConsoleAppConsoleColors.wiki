== Description ==

This property determines the foreground and background colours of a console.

If a console application shares the console of a parent console application then this property has no effect.

The colour enumeration values have the same colour as the similarly named _TColor_ constants.

The default values are `ccWhite` for the foreground and `ccBlack` for the background.

*Note:* A _TPJConsoleColors_ record can be created using the _!MakeConsoleColors_ function. There are two overloaded versions of this function, one which takes _TPJConsoleColor_ parameters and another that takes _TColor_ parameters. The latter version raises an exception if the _TColor_ values do not have an equivalent _TPJConsoleColor_ value.
