_Priority_ specifies the priorty with which the console application is started. Possible values are:

|| *Value* || *Description* ||
|| `cpDefault` || Default priority. Normally `cpNormal` is used unless the parent process has priority `cpIdle` in which case `cpIdle` is used. ||
|| `cpHigh` || High priority. Use for time-critical tasks (processor intensive). ||
|| `cpNormal` || Normal priority for applications with no specific scheduling needs. ||
|| `cpIdle` || Idle priority. The process is run only when the system is idle. ||
|| `cpRealTime` || Real time priority. Highest possible priority (pre-empts all threads, including the operating system). ||

The default value of _Priority_ is `cpDefault`.
