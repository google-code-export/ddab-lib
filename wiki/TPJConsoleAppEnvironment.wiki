== Description ==

_Environment_ provides a pointer to the environment block used by the console application.

The caller is responsible for allocating and freeing this memory, which must remain allocated while the console application is executing. If _Environment_ is `nil` then the console application inherits the parent process' environment block.

The default value of the property is `nil`.
