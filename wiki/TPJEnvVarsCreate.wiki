== Description ==

_Create_ constructs a new instance of the component. Only one instance of a _[TPJEnvVars TPJEnvVars]_ component is allowed on any form (or to be owned by any component). An attempt to create a second instance will cause an _Exception_ to be raised and the duplicate instance will not be created.

Multiple instances can be created by passing nil as the owner.
