== Description ==

The _Path_ property stores the directory of the special folder currently specified in _[FolderID FolderID]_.

If the folder is virtual then it is not in the file system and the _Path_ property is set to the empty string. Use the _[IsVirtual IsVirtual]_ property to check whether a folder is virtual or physical.

_Path_ is set to the empty string if the special folder is not supported by the operating system (see _[IsSupported IsSupported]_).
