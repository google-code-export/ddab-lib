== Description ==

_!ReadWdwState_ is used  used to read a window's size, position and state from the registry.

This protected method is overrridden by _[TPJRegWdwState TPJRegWdwState]_ to read the window's state, size and position information from the registry. Before reading the registry _!ReadWdwState_ triggers the _[TPJRegWdwStateOnGetRegData OnGetRegData]_ event to enable the user to change the key from which the state data is to be read.

The position of the window is returned in the _Left_ and _Top_ parameters, the size in the _Width_ and _Height_ parameters and the state in the _State_ parameter. _State_ is the ordinal value of a member of the _TWindowState_ enumeration: `wsMinimized`, `wsMaximized` or `wsNormal`. The parameters are set to those currently existing for the associated window before calling the method. 

This method is called by the _[TPJRegWdwStateRestore Restore]_ method.
