== Description ==

Use _!IsVirtual_ to determine if the current special folder is virtual or not.

When the property is false the special folder specified by _[FolderID FolderID]_ the folder is a physical folder in the file system and the _[Path Path]_ property gives its location. When _[IsVirtual IsVirtual]_ is true then the folder is not physically present in the file system and the _[Path Path]_ property is set to the empty string.

_!IsVirtual_ is set to false if the special folder is not supported by the operating system (see _[IsSupported IsSupported]_).
