= !WindowPosition property =

*Project:* [ConsoleAppClasses  Console Application Runner Classes].

*Unit:* _PJConsoleApp_.

*Class:* _[TPJConsoleApp TPJConsoleApp]_.

*Introduced:* v2.0

{{{
property WindowPosition: TPoint;
}}}

== Description ==

This property specifies the co-ordinates of the top left corner of a console application's window, in pixels. If either co-ordinate is less than zero then the default window position is used.

If a console application shares a console this property has no effect.

The property defaults to (-1, -1).

*Note:* Use the VCL's _Point_ function to create a _TPoint_ record with specified co-orindates on the fly. This should be used when setting the property value since the _X_ and _Y_ fields of _!WindowPosition_ cannot be written to directly.
