== Description ==

This read-only array property contains an indexed list of the fully specified names of the files dropped on the form. The array is zero based. The _[TPJFormDropFilesCount Count]_ property gives the number of files dropped. Attempts to access array elements outside the index range result in an exception being raised.

The contents of _Files_ may not exactly reflect all the names of the dropped files and folders. The listed files can be varied by changing the of the _[TPJFormDropFilesOptions Options]_ property. Furthermore, files filtered out via the _[TPJFormDropFilesFilter Filter]_ property or the _[TPJFormDropFilesOnFileFilter OnFileFilter]_ event handler are not included in _Files_. To ensure the property contains exactly the files and folders that were dropped set the _Options_ property to '[dfoIncFiles, dfoIncFolders]' (the default) and assign neither a _Filter_ component nor a _!OnFileFilter_ event handler.

To test whether the file at index _Idx_ is a file or a folder use _[TPJFormDropFilesIsFolder IsFolder]_.
