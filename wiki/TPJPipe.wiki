*Project:* [ConsoleAppClasses  Console Application Runner Classes].

*Unit:* _PJPipe_.

This is a helper class designed for use when redirecting output to and input from pipes. The class can create pipes with the inheritable handles that are required for redirecting the standard i/o of console applications.

_TPJPipe_ also provides methods that make working with with pipes easier. It can check the number of bytes in a readable pipe, can read bytes from a pipe into either a buffer or a stream and write bytes to a pipe from buffers and streams. Lastly it can safely close a pipe's write handle, effectively signalling end-of-file to the process reading it.

== Methods ==

|| _[TPJPipeReadData ReadData]_ || Reads data from the pipe into a buffer. ||
|| _[TPJPipeWriteBytes WriteBytes]_ || Writes the content of a byte array to the pipe.<br>_This method requires v2.0 or later._ ||
|| _[TPJPipeWriteData WriteData]_ || Writes data from a buffer to the pipe. ||

== Properties ==

|| *Property* || *Description* ||
|| _[TPJPipeReadHandle ReadHandle]_ || Windows handle used to read data from the pipe. ||
