= Environment Variables Unit =

|| This is the documentation for the *v2.0* release of the unit. If you are using a *version 3* release please [http://wiki.delphidabbler.com/index.php/Docs/EnvVars see here]. ||

This project contains the _PJEnvVars_ unit.

The unit contains a [PJEnvVarsRoutines set of routines] that can manipulate a process' environment block and the variables contained in it.

It also defines a component, _[TPJEnvVars TPJEnvVars]_,  that encapsulates a process' environment variables and provides an easy way to change their values, create then and delete them.

To see examples of using the code see the file `DemoCode.htm` that is distributed with the unit. Demo projects that implement the examples are available from the [http://www.delphidabbler.com/url/doodlings-repo Delphi Doodlings Repository] - see the `EnvVarsDemo` directory.

_*Note:* This documentation applies to v2.0 and later of the Environment Variables Unit._
