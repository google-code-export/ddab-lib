= !CanSpoof class function =

*Project:* [SystemInformationUnit System Information Unit].

*Unit:* _PJSysInfo_.

*Introduced:* v5.0

*Class:* _[TPJOSInfo TPJOSInfo]_

{{{
class function CanSpoof: Boolean;
}}}

== Description ==

Checks if the OS can be "spoofed" when the program is running in compatibility mode.

When this method returns `True` it indicates that some methods of _[TPJOSInfo]_ and some global variables will return the details of the compatibility mode OS instead of the actual one. 

When _!CanSpoof_ returns `False` returned OS information will be the  real underlying OS and the operating system compatibility mode is ignored.

See the documentation of the relevant methods and global variables for details of which of them are affected by OS spoofing.

*Note:* Exactly which OSs can be spoofed depends on how _PJSysInfo_ was compiled. By default, this will be Windows XP and earlier.
