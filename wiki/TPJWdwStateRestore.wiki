== Description ==

This method restores the size and position of the owning form's window according to value saved in a specified section of an ini file. The ini file name is specified by the _[TPJWdwStateIniFileName IniFileName]_ property and the section of the file where the data is recorded is given by the _[TPJWdwStateSection Section]_ property. If the ini file or section do not exist then this method has no effect.

Various values of the _[TPJCustomWdwStateOptions Options]_ property may cause either the saved size or state to be ignored or for the window to be repositioned (and possibly resized) to fit within the desktop's work area.

If the _[TPJCustomWdwStateAutoSaveRestore AutoSaveRestore]_ property is true _Restore_ is called automatically when the window is created.
