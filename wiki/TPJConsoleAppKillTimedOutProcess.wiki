{{{
property KillTimedOutProcess: Boolean;
}}}

== Description ==

When this property is `True` the console application will be forcibly terminated should it time out or be terminated via the _[TPJConsoleAppTerminate Terminate]_ method. Setting the property to `False` causes a timed out or terminated application to be left running after the _[TPJConsoleAppExecute Execute]_ method has returned, severing this object's connection with the application.

The Windows API _!TerminateProcess_ function is used to kill the application. This function does not perform a clean shut-down of the application. See Windows API help for details.

The default value of _!KillTimedOutProcess_ is `True`.
