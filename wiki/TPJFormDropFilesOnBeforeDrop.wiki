== Description ==

This event is triggered when files are dropped on the form but before the files are processed. If the processing of files is likely to be a lengthy occurence then an hourglass or similar user interface device can be displayed here.

The _[TPJFormDropFilesFiles Files]_ property does not yet contain details of the files dropped when this event is triggered, so the _Files_ property should not be read. The _[TPJFormDropFilesOnDropFiles OnDropFiles]_ event is triggered after the processing of files takes place. The _Files_ property should therefore be read in the _OnDropFiles_ event handler.
