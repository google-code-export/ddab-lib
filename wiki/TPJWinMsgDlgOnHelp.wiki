== Description ==

The _!OnHelp_ event is triggered when the user requests help in a dialogue either by clicking a help button or by pressing F1. If _!OnHelp_ is handled then the component's default help processing is inhibited - the event handler must display the required help.

This event is never triggered if the dialogue box does not display a help button. F1 keypresses are ignored when there is no help button.

Handle this event if you want to use an alternative help system to !WinHelp.
