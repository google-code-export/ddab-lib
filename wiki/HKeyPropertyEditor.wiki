#summary HKEY Property Editor documentation.

=HKEY Property Editor=

This is a property editor for properties of type _HKEY_ i.e. registry root keys. The editor causes a drop-down list of all the registry root keys supported by Delphi to be displayed in the object inspector for any property of type _HKEY_. Such a property is exposed by the [TPJRegWdwState] component.

The property editor class is named _TPJHKEYPropEditor_ and is defined in the _PJHKEYPropEdit_ unit.

_TPJHKEYPropEditor_ defines no new methods or properties over and above those defined by its parent class, _TPropertyEditor_.
