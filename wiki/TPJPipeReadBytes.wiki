*Class:* _[TPJPipe TPJPipe]_.

{{{

== Description ==

This method reads data from the pipe into a byte array. Parameters are:

 * _Count_: Number of bytes to read from the pipe. If _Count_ = 0 or greater than the number of available bytes then all the data from the pipe is read.

The required byte array is returned.

An _EInOutError_ exception is raised if there is an error peeking or reading the pipe.

*Note*: On versions of Delphi where _TBytes_ is not defined in _!SysUtils_, _PJPipe_ defines it as:

{{{
type TBytes = array of Byte;
}}}
