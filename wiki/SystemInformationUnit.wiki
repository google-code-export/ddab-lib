= System Information Unit =

This unit, _PJSysInfo_, contains a set of static classes that provide various pieces of system information. They are:

|| *Class* || *Description* ||
|| _[TPJComputerInfo TPJComputerInfo]_ || Provides information about the computer system. ||
|| _[TPJSystemFolders TPJSystemFolders]_ || Provides the paths of various standard system folders. ||
|| _[TPJOSInfo TPJOSInfo]_ || Provides information about the operating system. ||

The _PJSysInfo_ unit also defines a set of [PJSysInfoGlobals global variables] that compliment and extend the operating system information provided by global variables defined in the _!SysUtils_ unit. 

Certain Windows types and constants not defined by Delphi that assist in working with extended operating system information are declared in this unit. Help on these definitions can be found on MSDN or in the Windows platform SDK.

== Deprecated & Removed Code ==

Versions of _PJSysInfo_ prior to v3.0 contained a set of deprecated routines and a deprecated component that duplicated a subset of the system information exposed by the classes and global variables above.

From v3.0 this deprecated code was not compiled unless the _PJSYSINFO_COMPILE_DEPRECATED_ symbol was defined before compiling the unit.

The deprecated code was removed entirely at v4.0.
