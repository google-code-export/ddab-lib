*Class:* _[TPJConsoleApp TPJConsoleApp]_.

*Introduced:* v1.0

property ElapsedTime: LongWord;

== Description ==

This read only property specifies the approximate time in milliseconds since the console application began executing. The clock stops when the application completes or times out.

This property is updated only when the application yields control to this class. The frequency with which this happens depends on the _[TPJConsoleAppTimeSlice TimeSlice]_ property. If _[TPJConsoleAppTimeSlice TimeSlice]_ is `INFINITE` then _!ElapsedTime_ is only updated once the application terminates.

Examine _!ElapsedTime_ in a _[TPJConsoleAppOnWork OnWork]_ event handler to get the updated execution time while a process is executing. Examine the property after a process has completed to get the total execution time.

Times are approximate.
