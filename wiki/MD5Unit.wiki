= MD5 Message Digest Unit =

This unit contains an implementation of the MD5 message digest algorithm. The unit defines the following key types:

|| _[TPJMD5 TPJMD5]_ || Class that implements the MD5 message digest algorithm and provides overloaded methods that make it easy to get a digest for various data types. ||
|| _[TPJMD5Digest TPJMD5Digest]_ || Record that encapsulates a MD5 digest as generated by _TPJMD5_. Provides means to cast the digest too and from a byte array or string and to compare digests. ||

The code has been developed from scratch based on the algorithm presented in [http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc1321.html RFC 1321]. Portions of the code are translated from the reference C code supplied in the RFC. Note though that the code is not a literal translation into Pascal from the reference C code.

_The algorithm and reference code are copyright (C) 1991-2, RSA Data Security, Inc. Created 1991. All rights reserved._

[http://dunit.sourceforge.net/ DUnit] tests for the code are available to help you test the code's accuracy - and the code is in a state where it can pass the tests.

  _*NOTE: The code is currently in beta and the interface is liable to change*_

== Rationale ==

So why write this code?

Well, I've been searching for a more up-to-date implementation of the MD5 message digest, written in Delphi, that meets these criteria:

  # No dependency on C .obj files or DLLs - must be pure Pascal code.
  # Open source with a license compatible with the MPL because I want to use it in an MPLd application of mine, so GPL-only code is ruled out.
  # Compiles and works with the Unicode Delphi Compilers.
  # Object oriented.
  # Easy to get an MD5 digest from all sorts of data without messing around converting it and playing with contexts etc.

The version I'd been using passed the first 2 tests but failed the last three. And it is no longer being updated. And it took me quite some time to persuade it to work in the Unicode world of Delphi 2010.

It just seemed easier to start again.
