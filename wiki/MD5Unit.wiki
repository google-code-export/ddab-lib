= MD5 Message Digest Unit =

This unit contains an implementation of the MD5 message digest algorithm. The unit defines the following types:

|| _[TPJMD5 TPJMD5]_ || Class that implements the MD5 message digest algorithm and provides overloaded methods that make it easy to get a digest for various data types. ||
|| _[TPJMD5Digest TPJMD5Digest]_ || Record that encapsulates a MD5 digest as generated by _[TPJMD5 TPJMD5]_. Provides a means to cast the digest to and from a byte array or string and to compare digests. ||

The code has been developed from scratch based on the algorithm presented in [http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc1321.html RFC 1321]. Portions of the code are translated from the reference C code supplied in the RFC. However the code is *not* a literal translation into Pascal from the reference C code.

_The algorithm and reference code are copyright (C) 1991-2, RSA Data Security, Inc. Created 1991. All rights reserved. This implementation is copyright (C) 2010, Peter D Johnson (www.delphidabbler.com)._

[http://dunit.sourceforge.net/ DUnit] tests are available to help you test the code's accuracy. The code is in a state where it can pass the tests.

  _*NOTE: The code is currently in beta. The interface may change.*_

== Rationale ==

So why write this code? Well, I had been searching for a more up-to-date implementation of the MD5 message digest, written in Delphi, that met these criteria:

  # No dependency on C .obj files or DLLs - had to be pure Pascal code.
  # Open source with a license compatible with the Mozilla Public License.
  # Must compile and work with the Unicode Delphi Compilers.
  # Object oriented.
  # Easy to get an MD5 digest various different data types without having to convert the data or mess about with contexts etc.

The version I'd been using passed the first two tests but failed the last three. It is no longer being updated and it took me quite some time to persuade it to work in the Unicode world of Delphi 2010. 

It just seemed easier to start again.
