== Description ==

This property specifies the security and inheritance attributes for the console application process. It determines whether the process handle can be inherited by child processes. Setting _!ProcessAttrs_ to nil means the process handle can't be inherited.

Note that the caller is responsible for setting up the structure correctly. The caller need not maintain a copy of the provided structure once the property is set since _[TPJConsoleApp TPJConsoleApp]_ makes an internal copy.

The property's default value is `nil`.
