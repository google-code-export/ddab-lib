== Description ==

This virtual protected method triggers the _[TPJConsoleAppOnComplete OnComplete]_ event. Descendants can override to perform specific actions without triggering the event. If the event is still required `inherited` can be called.

The method would usually be implemented to perform any required actions to tidy up when a console application completes its run.
