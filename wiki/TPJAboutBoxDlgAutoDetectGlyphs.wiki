== Description ==

*DEPRECATED*

The About box contains one button which is used to close the dialog box. This button can display a glyph, which is determined by the _[TPJAboutBoxDlgButtonGlyph ButtonGlyph]_ property. _!AutoDetectGlyphs_ determines whether or not the glyph is displayed.

When _!AutoDetectGlyphs_ is False glyphs are displayed according to the _!ButtonGlyph_ property but when the.property is false _!ButtonGlyph_ is ignored and no glyph is displayed on the button.

_!AutoDetectGlyphs_ is *deprecated*. It was only of real use when the component was used with Delphi 1, when a different default behaviour was expected to that with Delphi 2. To inhibit the display of glyphs you should set _!AutoDetectGlyphs_ to False and set the _!ButtonGlyph_ property to `abgNone` (the default).

The default value is False.
