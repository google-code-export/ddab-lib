== Description ==

This method copies data from a stream into the pipe. Parameters are:

 * _Stm_: Stream from which to copy data.
 * _Count_: Number of bytes to copy. If 0 then all the remaining data from the stream is copied to the pipe.

An _EInOutError_ exception is raised if the pipe's write handle has been closed or if the pipe can't be written to. _EReadError_ is raised if the stream read fails.
