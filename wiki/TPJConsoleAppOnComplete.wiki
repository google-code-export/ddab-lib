== Description ==

This event is triggered when an application completes or times out. It is *always* called and is also guaranteed to be called *after* the last _[TPJConsoleAppOnWork OnWork]_ event.

Handle this event to tidy up after the console process is completed. _[TPJConsoleAppProcessInfo ProcessInfo]_ is available when this event is triggered. The _[TPJConsoleAppErrorCode ErrorCode]_ property can be used to check how the application terminated – it will be zero if the application executed successfully, did not timeout and was not terminated.
