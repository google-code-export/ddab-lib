= Hot Label Component =

The _PJHotLabel_ unit contains a single component, _[TPJHotLabel TPJHotLabel]_, that implements a label control that can access a URL when clicked.

Several types are defined in the unit in total. They are:

|| _[TPJHotLabel TPJHotLabel]_ || The Hot Label Component itself. ||
|| _[EPJURLError EPJURLError]_  || A custom exception that is raised by _[TPJHotLabel TPJHotLabel]_ when URL related errors are encountered. ||
|| _TPJHLHintStyle_ || An emumeration of hint styles used by the _[TPJHotLabelHintStyle HintStyle]_ property. See the property's documentation for details. ||
|| _TPJHLCustomHintEvent_ || The type of event triggered by the _[TPJHotLabelOnCustomHint OnCustomHint]_ event. See the event's documentation for details. ||

== Examples ==

Two examples provide some ideas as to how to use the component:

|| [HotLabelExample1 Example 1] || Using Highlighting - illustrates the use of text highlighting to indicate that a hot label is clickable. ||
|| [HotLabelExample1 Example 2] || Using the _[TPJHotLabelOnCustomHint OnCustomHint]_ event. ||

A further example is provided by the demo program that is included in the download.
