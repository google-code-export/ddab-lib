== Description ==

_!CurrentDir_ specifies the current directory of a console application executed by the parameterless version _[TPJConsoleAppExecute Execute]_.

If the property is set to the empty string (the default) then the console application is executed with the same current directory as its parent program.

*Remarks*

If _[TPJConsoleAppExecute Execute]_ is called with _!CmdLine_ and _!CurrentDir_ parameters then this property is set to the value of the _!CurrentDir_ parameter.
