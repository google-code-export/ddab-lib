== Description ==

This method reads data from the pipe into a buffer. Parameters are:

 * _Buf_: Buffer that receives the data from the pipe. _Buf_ must have capacity of at least _!BufSize_ bytes.
 * _!BufSize_: Size of the buffer or the number of bytes requested, which must be less than or equal to the size of the buffer.
 * _!BytesRead_: Set by the method to the number of bytes actually read.

`True` is returned if some data was read, `False` if not.

An _EInOutError_ exception is raised if there is an error peeking or reading the pipe.
