{{{
property OnStart: TNotifyEvent;
}}}

== Description ==

This event is triggered after console application process is created, just before it starts executing.

It is *always* called before the first _[TPJConsoleAppOnWork OnWork]_ event.

Handle this event to take any necessary action before the application starts executing. _[TPJConsoleAppProcessInfo ProcessInfo]_ is available when this event is triggered, so you will typically handle the event if you need access to process information at this stage.
