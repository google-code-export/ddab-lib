== Description ==

Set this property to the text that you wish to display in the body on the dialog box. The default is to display nothing.

*Note:* Line breaks in the dialog box can be forced by including CR LF pairs in the _Text_ string. This can't be done at design time using the standard Delphi string property editor. However the !DelphiDabbler [ExStringPropertyEditor Extended String Property Editor] enables multiple lines of text to be assigned at design time.
