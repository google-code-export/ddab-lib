= !CalculateFile method =

*Project:* [MD5Unit MD5 Message Digest Unit].

*Unit:* _PJMD5_.

*Class:* _[TPJMD5 TPJMD5]_

{{{
class function CalculateFile(const FileName: TFileName): TPJMD5Digest;
}}}

== Description == 

This class method is very like the _[TPJMD5Calculate Calculate]_ methods in that it provides a useful shortcut when you want to get the MD5 hash of a single file. Just call this method and pass the path to the required file in the _!FileName_ parameter and read the function result to get the required digest.

Again, like _[TPJMD5Calculate Calculate]_, there is no need to create an instance of _[TPJMD5 TPJMD5]_.

The disadvantage of this method over the similar _[TPJMD5ProcessFile ProcessFile]_ is that there is no way to change the default size of the buffer used to read the file. The buffer size is that given by _[TPJMD5 TPJMD5]_'s _!DefReadBufferSize_  constant.
