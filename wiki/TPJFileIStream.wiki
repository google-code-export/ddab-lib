#summary TPJFileIStream class description.

= TPJFileIStream =

_TPJFileIStream_ provides an _IStream_ interface to a file. It's constructor is like that of _TFileStream_ except that the constructor returns an object of type _TPJFileIStream_ which can be cast to _IStream_.

The _Stat_ method of _TPJFileIStream_, like that of _[TPJHandleIStreamWrapper]_, provides file date / time stamp information. Additionally, the _pwcsName_ element of the _TStatStg_ structure returns the name of the open file rather than a name based on the class name.
