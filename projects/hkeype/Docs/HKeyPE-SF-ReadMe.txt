HKEY Property Editor
--------------------

**WARNING** This property editor is deprecated. You are strongly advised NOT to
use it.

The property editor works erratically. On some Delphi installations it works
fine while on others the object inspector does not recognise the editor. The
problem has proved to be intractable, so it has been decided not to continue to
maintain the code.

There will be no further releases.
