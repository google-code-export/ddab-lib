	Console Application Runner Classes<br />
	<span class="subtitle">ReadMe</span>
</h1>


<h2 id="desc">
	Description
</h2>

<p>
	These classes are designed to be used to control the execution of child
	console application processes and to redirect input and output where
	required.
</p>

<p>
	The main class &ndash; <var>TPJConsoleApp</var> &ndash; will run console
	applications. It enables the console application's standard input, standard
	output and standard error to be redirected to and from files or pipes.
</p>

<p>
	The class can also timeslice the running of the console application to
	enable the calling application to continue processing and to enable
	redirected piped output to be processed.
</p>

<p>
	Various other properties of the console application can also be configured,
	including:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		Whether the application's process and thread handles can be inherited.
	</li>
	<li>
		Whether the application is visible or is displayed in a new console
		window.
	</li>
	<li>
		The console window's title.
	</li>
	<li>
		The environment block passed to the application.
	</li>
	<li>
		The application's maximum execution time. The process can be forcibly
		terminated if it times-out.
	</li>
	<li>
		The application's priority.
	</li>
</ul>

<p>
	If the class fails to execute the application it sets an <var>ExitCode</var>
	and an <var>ErrorMessage</var> property. The exit code of the application is
	returned via the <var>ExitCode</var> property. Errant applications can be
	terminated.
</p>

<p>
	<var>TPJConsoleApp</var> descends from <var>TPJCustomConsoleApp</var>, which
	provides all the functionality of the derived class, except that all
	properties are protected. <var>TPJCustomConsoleApp</var> should be used if
	you need to create subclasses. Subclasses should make required properties
	public.
</p>

<p>
	<var>TPJPipe</var> is a helper class that assists in working with pipes used
	for redirecting input / output. This class simplifies reading and writing to
	pipes.
</p>

<p>
	A comprehensive PDF user guide can be downloaded separately.

<h3 id="compatibility">
   Compatibility
</h3>

<p>
	The Console Application Runner Classes were originally developed and tested
	with Delphi 7 and need this compiler as a minimum. Since v1.0.2 the classes
	have been modified to work with later Unicode versions of Delphi, i.e.
	Delphi 2009 and 2010.
</p>


<h2 id="installation">
	Installation
</h2>

<p>
	The Console Application Runner Classes and associated documentation and demo
	programs are supplied in a zip file. Before installing, or using, you need
	to extract all the files from the zip file, preserving the directory
	structure. The following files will be extracted:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		<code><strong>PJConsoleApp.pas</strong></code> &ndash; The source code
		of the console application runner classes.
	</li>
	<li>
		<code><strong>PJPipe.pas</strong></code> &ndash; Source code for the
		supporting <var>TPJPipe</var> class.
	</li>
	<li>
		<code>Docs\ChangeLog.txt</code> &ndash; The project's change log.
	</li>
	<li>
		<code>Docs\MPL.txt</code> &ndash; Mozilla Public License v1.1.
	</li>
	<li>
		<code>Docs\ReadMe.htm</code> &ndash; The project's read-me file.
	</li>
	<li>
		<code>Docs\Wiki.URL</code> &ndash; Shortcut to the online Wiki that
		documents the project.
	</li>
</ul>

<p>
	In addition to the above files you will find numerous demo projects in the
	<code>Demos</code> sub-directory.
</p>

<p>
	There are three possible ways to use the units.
</p>

<ol class="spaced">
	<li>
		The simplest way is to add <code>PJConsoleApp.pas</code> and
		<code>PJPipe.pas</code> to your projects as you need them.
	</li>
	<li>
		To make the units easier to re-use you can either copy them to a folder
		on your Delphi search path, or add the folder where you extracted the
		units to the Delphi Search path. You then simply use the units as
		required without needing to add them to your project.
	</li>
	<li>
		For maximum portability you can add the units to a Delphi design time
		package. If you need help doing this <a
			href="http://www.delphidabbler.com/url/install-comp"
		>see here</a>.
	</li>
</ol>


<h2 id="demo">
	Demo Programs
</h2>

<p>
	The source code for ten demo projects is included in the download, along
	with two console applications that are required by the demos. All the demos
	are stored in subfolders of the <code>Demos</code> directory.
</p>

<p>
	Make sure you preserved the directory structure when unzipping the
	downloaded archive. Open <code>PJConsoleAppDemos.bpg</code> in Delphi.
	Compile each of the ten demo projects and the two programs in the
	<code>TestApps</code> sub-directory. All the resulting <code>.exe</code>
	files should have been written to the <code>Exe</code> directory.
</p>

<p>
	The demo programs are fully described in the <em>Examples</em> section of
	the <a
		href="http://www.delphidabbler.com/download?id=consoleapp&amp;type=docs"
	>PDF user guide</a>.
</p>
