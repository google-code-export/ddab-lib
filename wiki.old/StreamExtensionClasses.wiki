= Stream Extension Classes =

This library project provides some classes that can be used to extend the functionality of Delphi's _TStream_ classes.

The classes are provided in two units: _PJStreamWrapper_ and _PJIStreams_. The classes are summarised in the following table.

|| *Class* || *Unit* || *Description* ||
|| [TPJStreamWrapper] || PJStreamWrapper || This is a base class for descendant classes that "wrap" a _TStream_ class to provide some form of filter or additional functionality. The wrapped _TStream_ is used to do physical i/o. _TStreamWrapper_ simply replicates the facilities in the wrapped stream â€“ it is for descendant classes to add functionality. ||
|| [TPJIStreamWrapper] || PJIStreams || Implements the _IStream_ interface for a wrapped _TStream_ object. ||
|| [TPJHandleIStreamWrapper] || PJIStreams || Implements an _IStream_ interface for a wrapped _THandleStream_ object or descendant such as _TFileStream_). Acts in a similar way to _TPJIStreamWrapper_ except that file date stamps are returned by the _Stat_ method. ||
|| [TPJFileIStream] || PJIStreams || Implements a _IStream_ interface on a file. ||
