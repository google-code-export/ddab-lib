= Shell Folders Unit =

Two units are actually provided: _PJShellFolders_ and _PJShellFoldersDsgn_.

== PJShellFolders ==

This unit provides components, classes and routines to assist in working with shell folders. There are two components:

  * _[TPJSpecialFolderInfo TPJSpecialFolderInfo]_ - provides information about the Shell's various special folders.
  * _[TPJBrowseDialog TPJBrowseDialog]_ - provides access to the Browse for Folder dialog box.

There is also a class - _[TPJSpecialFolderEnum TPJSpecialFolderEnum]_ that enumerates the shell's special folder identifiers. This class implements the _[IPJSpecialFolderEnum IPJSpecialFolderEnum]_ interface. Functions that provide information about the special folder identifiers and symbolic constants are also provided.

_PJShellFolders_ also provides [PJShellFoldersFunctions two functions] to provide information about the folders described by PIDLs.

== PJShellFoldersDsgn ==

This unit provides design time support. In particular it provides a property editor for _[TPJBrowseDialog TPJBrowseDialog]_ and _[TPJSpecialFolderInfo TPJSpecialFolderInfo]_ that allows predefined special folder IDs to be selected in the object inspector.
